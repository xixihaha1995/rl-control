#### General EPlus Question
SimulationControl,
    Yes,                     !- Do Zone Sizing Calculation
    Yes,                     !- Do System Sizing Calculation
    Yes,                     !- Do Plant Sizing Calculation
    No,                      !- Run Simulation for Sizing Periods
    Yes,                     !- Run Simulation for Weather File Run Periods
    No,                      !- Do HVAC Sizing Simulation for Sizing Periods
    1;                       !- Maximum Number of HVAC Sizing Simulation Passes
Why does this line matter, "Do HVAC Sizing Simulation for Sizing Periods"?
